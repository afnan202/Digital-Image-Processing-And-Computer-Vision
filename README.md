# Digital-Image-Processing-And-Computer-Vision
This repository documents my learning journey in Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision, covering image filtering, morphological operations, edge detection, segmentation, and object recognition using OpenCV and Matplotlib. Summarized notes are included to support both personal and public learning effectively.

The initial phase of this learning pathway focuses on the fundamentals of image representation, enhancement, and transformation. I have studied essential operations such as image filtering, contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and noise removal, which are vital for improving image quality and preparing visual data for further analysis. Building on these foundations, I explored feature extraction and edge detection techniques, including Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian operators, to identify and analyze significant structures and boundaries within images.

Moving further into Computer Vision, I have examined methods related to object detection, segmentation, and feature matching, which enable systems to recognize and interpret visual information. Practical implementation has been an integral part of this learning process, utilizing libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to execute various image processing and visualization tasks. These experiments have deepened my understanding of how traditional image processing approaches integrate with contemporary deep learning frameworks to achieve robust and adaptive visual recognition.

In addition to code implementations, this repository includes concise notes and summaries to highlight key insights and maintain a clear conceptual understanding of each topic. The content is designed not only for personal reference but also to help others beginning their exploration of DIP and CV.

Overall, this repository reflects a consistent effort to blend theoretical learning, practical application, and documentation. It serves as both a personal reference and a shared resource for learners, researchers, and practitioners interested in the evolving field of Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision.
